1. Purpose

This document formally declares that the Stablecoin Vertical Application Template adopts and operates under the governance authority of Prospera OS.

This declaration establishes a clear authority boundary between:

Prospera OS as the sole governance authority, and

This repository as a client-side, non-authoritative implementation template.

This declaration is mandatory for any vertical application template that claims compatibility with Prospera OS governance.

2. Adoption Statement

This repository explicitly adopts:

The governance rules, invariants, and enforcement logic defined by Prospera OS

The non-overridable constraints enforced by the Prospera OS Kernel

The Governable Decision Chain defined by Prospera OS governance specifications

This repository does not define, modify, reinterpret, or override any governance authority.

3. Authority Boundary

This repository explicitly declares the following authority boundaries:

❌ No governance authority is defined or implied within this repository

❌ No kernel-level rules are defined within this repository

❌ No decision finality exists within this repository

All authoritative governance decisions MUST originate from Prospera OS canonical governance layers.

This repository functions strictly as a governance-adopting client template.

4. AI Role Declaration (AI as Engineering Worker)

Within this repository:

Artificial intelligence systems are designated strictly as Engineering Workers

AI systems have no decision authority

AI systems may not:

Define governance rules

Override kernel constraints

Initiate autonomous execution

Approve or reject actions independently

All AI-generated outputs are treated as non-authoritative engineering artifacts subject to governance validation, human review, or system escalation as defined by Prospera OS.

This repository does not implement autonomous AI agents.

5. Stablecoin-Specific Constraints

Given the regulatory, financial, and systemic risks associated with stablecoin systems, this repository explicitly acknowledges:

Monetary authority constraints

Financial compliance requirements

Jurisdictional regulatory variance

Custody, reserve, and redemption risks

Data protection and customer identity obligations

No stablecoin-related action defined in this repository may bypass Prospera OS governance, kernel enforcement, or system-level validation.

6. Non-Assertion Clause

This repository explicitly does not assert:

Monetary authority

Regulatory approval

Financial endorsement

Legal compliance certification

All such determinations remain external and must be validated through appropriate governance and regulatory channels.

7. Canonical Reference

The canonical source of governance authority for all content in this repository is:

Continued non-assertion of governance authority

Removal or weakening of governance adoption language is prohibited.

9. Final Declaration
