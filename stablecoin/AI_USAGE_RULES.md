AI Usage Rules — Stablecoin Client Repository
Document Type: AI Usage Policy
Status: Canonical (Adopted)
Version: v1.0
Date: 2026-01-05
Maintained by: Client Organization
Governing Authority: Prospera OS (External)

Purpose

This document defines the mandatory rules governing
the use of artificial intelligence systems within
the Stablecoin Client Repository operating under Prospera OS governance.

It ensures that AI functions strictly as an engineering worker
and never as a decision-maker, authority holder, or execution agent.

---

Foundational Principle

Artificial intelligence is designated as an Engineering Worker.

AI may generate artifacts and analysis,
but possesses no authority, no approval rights,
and no execution privileges.

This principle is non-negotiable.

---

Permitted AI Activities

AI systems MAY be used for the following purposes only:

- Drafting source code under human direction
- Assisting with technical documentation
- Analyzing test results and logs
- Performing scenario simulations
- Supporting compliance preparation
- Generating non-authoritative reports

All outputs are advisory and non-binding.

---

Prohibited AI Activities

AI systems MUST NOT perform any of the following:

- Authorize, approve, or reject decisions
- Execute minting, burning, or redemption actions
- Modify governance or policy artifacts
- Alter authority boundaries or escalation paths
- Access data beyond approved scope
- Communicate externally on behalf of the organization
- Trigger automated workflows without approval
- Act autonomously or self-invoke

Any attempt to perform prohibited activities
must be blocked and escalated.

---

Human Review Requirement

All AI-generated artifacts MUST:

- Be reviewed by a responsible human maintainer
- Be validated for governance compliance
- Be traceable to a human request

Unreviewed AI outputs are invalid for execution or release.

---

Traceability and Logging

All AI-assisted activities must be:

- Logged with timestamps
- Associated with a responsible human actor
- Retained for audit and compliance review

Lack of traceability constitutes non-compliance.

---

Enforcement and Escalation

Violations of AI usage rules must be escalated
to Prospera OS governance without delay.

Non-compliant artifacts may be invalidated or removed.

---

Canonical Statement

AI supports engineering.
Humans retain authority.
