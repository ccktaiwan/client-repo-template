Purpose

This document defines the non-negotiable authority boundary
for the Stablecoin Client Repository operating under Prospera OS governance.

It serves as a hard constraint to prevent authority confusion,
governance leakage, or unintended delegation.

---

Authority Boundary

This repository is strictly non-authoritative.

It MUST NOT define, modify, interpret, or override:

- Governance rules or policies
- Decision authority or escalation paths
- Kernel enforcement logic
- AI participation boundaries
- Audit or compliance requirements

All such authority originates exclusively from Prospera OS.

---

Permitted Scope

This repository MAY:

- Implement approved execution artifacts
- Maintain documentation and decision records
- Support testing and validation
- Prepare compliance and audit materials
- Use AI strictly as an engineering worker

All permitted activities must remain within adopted governance boundaries.

---

Prohibited Scope

This repository MUST NOT:

- Declare or authorize decisions
- Execute actions outside approved scope
- Grant AI any form of authority or autonomy
- Alter governance artifacts by reference or implication
- Introduce enforcement or policy tooling

Any such action constitutes a governance violation.

---

Enforcement and Escalation

Suspected boundary violations must be escalated
to Prospera OS governance without delay.

Non-compliant artifacts may be invalidated or removed.

---

Canonical Statement

Authority does not reside in this repository.
Authority is enforced by Prospera OS.
