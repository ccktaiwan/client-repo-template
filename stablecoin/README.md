Prospera OS — Stablecoin Client Repository Template
Document Type: Client Repository Template
Status: Stable
Version: v1.0
Date: 2026-01-05
Maintained by: Prospera Architecture Group

Purpose

This repository serves as the official client implementation template
for stablecoin projects operating under Prospera OS governance.

It provides a safe engineering environment for implementation,
documentation, and AI-assisted execution within predefined
governance boundaries.

This repository does NOT define governance authority.

---

Governance Authority

All governance rules, decision chains, and enforcement logic
are defined exclusively in the Prospera OS repository.

This client repository adopts governance by reference and
must not redefine or override any governance rule.

- Stablecoin Vertical Governance Playbook v1.0
- Stablecoin Data Usage Decision Chain v1.0
- Stablecoin Mint / Burn Decision Chain v1.0
- Stablecoin Marketing & Distribution Decision Chain v1.0

All implementation work MUST comply with these artifacts.

AI Usage Rules

AI systems may be used only as Engineering Workers.

AI is permitted to:
- Generate code drafts
- Assist with documentation
- Analyze test results
- Simulate scenarios

AI is prohibited from:
- Authorizing decisions
- Executing mint/burn
- Modifying governance logic
- Accessing data outside approved scope

All AI-generated artifacts require human review.

What This Repository Is For

- Stablecoin system implementation
- Smart contract development under governance
- Integration testing
- Compliance documentation
- AI-assisted engineering work (non-authoritative)

---

What This Repository Is NOT For

- Defining governance or policy
- Bypassing authorization
- Autonomous AI execution
- Monetary decision-making
- Regulatory interpretation

Any attempt to do so constitutes a governance violation.
