Authority Boundary

This repository is a client-facing project template intended for implementation and delivery under Prospera OS governance.

It does not define governance authority, system rules, execution constraints, or enforcement logic. All canonical governance, execution definitions, and authority boundaries are defined exclusively by Prospera OS.

No content in this repository may redefine, override, or reinterpret Prospera OS authority.

Repository Purpose

This repository serves as a client-facing implementation workspace operating under adopted Prospera OS governance.

It is intended for engineering implementation, documentation, AI-assisted execution, testing, validation, and delivery activities that occur strictly within predefined governance boundaries.

This repository does not define governance rules, authority models, escalation logic, or enforcement mechanisms.

Governance Adoption Model

This repository adopts Prospera OS governance as its governing framework.

All governance authority, rules, enforcement mechanisms, escalation paths, and decision boundaries are defined externally and are not owned by this repository.

Formal adoption of governance is declared through the governance adoption declaration document referenced below.

Permitted Use

This repository may be used for software implementation and configuration, architecture realization based on approved specifications, documentation of implementation artifacts, AI-assisted code generation under permitted participation modes, and testing, validation, and delivery activities.

All activities must comply with adopted governance specifications and execution constraints.

Explicit Prohibitions

This repository must not be used to define or modify governance rules, redefine authority ownership or escalation paths, override AI participation boundaries, introduce enforcement logic or governance tooling, or treat AI-generated outputs as authoritative decisions.

Any attempt to perform these actions constitutes a governance violation.

AI Usage Constraints

AI systems may be used only as permitted by the adopted governance specifications.

AI-generated outputs are advisory unless explicitly reviewed and approved by a responsible human actor.

AI systems do not hold authority and may not make final decisions, enforce rules, or override human judgment.

All AI-assisted activities must remain traceable, reviewable, and auditable.

Authority and Responsibility

Human maintainers retain full authority and responsibility for all outcomes produced within this repository.

Responsibility cannot be delegated to tools, models, or automation.

AI systems do not possess authority under any circumstance.

Governance Compliance and Auditability

This repository is subject to governance audit and review under Prospera OS.

All work artifacts must be traceable to responsible human actors.

Non-compliant artifacts may be invalidated.

In cases of uncertainty, ambiguity, or conflict, governance escalation is mandatory.
